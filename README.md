# ToradorAPI
Welcome to the official ToradorAPI Documentation.

## What is ToradorAPI?
ToradorAPI is an API providing you with images of various characters from the Anmime Toradora! (a true masterpiece, trust me)

## How to Contribute Images?
We currently only accept fanart and screenshots from the anime. We also do not accept GIFs at the moment, but this will change in the future.

### Important info
The following large image sources are mostly added into the image database, so you shouldn't add them, as it would cause in lots of duplicates
* Toradora Wikia/Fandom Taiga Gallery (Taiga, Ami, Yasuko)

### 1. Forking the repo
First of all, you have to fork our [images repository](https://github.com/toradorapi/images). If you don't know how to fork repositories. Check out [this](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) guide.

### 2. Add your images
Go to the folder (original for anime screenshots or fanart) and open the JSON file of your character. If your character does not exist, create an issue in the images repository, so I can add it, but please don't just create it yourself, as a new character also needs some minor modifications in the API.
To add the image to the JSON file you just need to copy the section between and including the "{" and "}" from another entry and change the values. For URL add a **direct** link to the image (For fanarts from Pixiv please re-upload them on a service like imgur, as there are some problems with Pixiv's Links). For Source enter the name of Fanart Artist and the platform it was published on (e.g. Pixiv) or for Screenshot to the website you got it from or to yourself if you did the screenshot yourself.
Please also make sure that after every element between the "{" and "}" there has to be a comma. This does not apply to the last one. After the last one there has to be no comma.

### 3. Doing a pull-request
At last, you only have to create a pull request. If you don't know how to do a pull request, check out [this](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) guide.
Now you only have to wait a few minutes and the changes should be up and running!
